# 📨 Free and Open Source Spam Filtering Tools 📨

## 👨‍💻 Open Source Roots 👩‍💻

SpamTagger is an organization founded by the former head of development for the former MailCleaner® antispam gateway. We seek to take the open source roots of MailCleaner® and extend it to all aspects of the project code, infrastructure and build tools.

## 🚧 Continued MailCleaner® Development 🚧

MailCleaner® has been discontinued. [SpamTagger](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger) is a fork to revive MailCleaner® as an entirely free and open source project.

An initial release will be made available after significant upgrades are complete while maintaining compatibility with MailCleaner® configurations.

The pace of development for SpamTagger is expected to slow down after the first release with MailCleaner® and stability as the main goals. Some features may be ported from the SpamTagger Core project where it is easy and makes sense. Additional contributions from the community will be considered.

## ✨ A New, Lighter-Weight Spam Filtering Solution ✨

Eventually, a new fork called [SpamTagger Core](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger-Core) will be created which will seek to provide a simplified filtering tool, inspired by SpamTagger but without compatibility guarantees.

This project will seek to remove any non-essential features for spam filtering. It will replace user quarantines with better tagging to route mail to the relevant "Junk" folder on the back-end server. It will replace the robust Web UI with a full-features TUI wizard for administration and an API so that it can be more easily integrated into other products.

This new architecture should allow for much more active development on new features, focused on increasing spam filtering quality, and supporting a wider variety of environments.

## 🧰 Open Anti-Spam Tools 🧰

A spam filter is nothing without good rules and training data. SpamTagger will seek to find novel ways to provide similar constantly improving filtering policies and tools from contributors across the globe.

This will include community sourced SpamC rules, tools for hybrid local and shared bayes training, dynamic RBLs, new prefiltering modules, and other projects.

The best efforts will be made to ensure that these tools work equally well in non-SpamTagger filtering environments.
